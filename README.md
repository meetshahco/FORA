# FORA

**Turn a job description into a personalised application landing page.**

FORA is an open-source agentic pipeline for designers. You give it a job description. It reads your profile, analyses the role, runs a focused brainstorm, and produces a tailored page — three acts: who you are, what you've done (framed for this company), and what you'll bring in the first 90 days.

No generic applications. No templates that look like templates.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meetshahco/FORA.git
cd FORA
chmod +x setup.sh brainstorm.sh codegen.sh run.sh

# Step 1 — health check and profile build (once)
./setup.sh

# Step 2 — every application from here on
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` handles everything — brainstorm, mode selection, generate, deploy — in one guided flow. It asks for the JD URL when you run it. No API keys needed to start.

---

## What you'll build

In your first afternoon with FORA:

```
✓ Build your private career knowledge base (profile.json)
✓ Brainstorm one application against a real JD
✓ Generate a personalised landing page
✓ Publish it live (optional)

Result: a URL you can send in a cold message
→ https://fora-pages.vercel.app/company-role
```

---

## Usage options

FORA is tool-agnostic and cost-optional. You choose how to generate and deploy **per application** — not once during setup. Anthropic and Vercel are fully independent.

| Option | Codegen | Deploy | Keys needed |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Manual codegen via AI chat | Manual deploy via any static host | None |
| 2 ★ | Manual codegen via AI chat | Auto deploy via Vercel | Vercel token |
| 3 | Auto codegen via Anthropic API | Manual deploy via any static host | Anthropic key |
| 4 | Auto codegen via Anthropic API | Auto deploy via Vercel | Both |

★ Option 2 is the most practical starting point — permanent URL with zero Anthropic cost.

`run.sh` detects which keys you have and shows only what's available. Start with option 1, add keys when you're ready, and options unlock automatically — no reconfiguration needed.

## Key concepts

**profile.json** is private and lives only on your machine. It contains your career, case studies, philosophy, and tone of voice. Every application pulls from it — the more specific it is, the better every application gets.

**content_brief.json** is the contract between brainstorm and codegen. The AI writes it; `generate.js` (or you, manually) reads it. It specifies which works to show, what to say in each act, which template to use, and design system direction.

**Templates** control section order and layout. Three are included: `three-act` (default), `work-first` (leads with proof), `single-statement` (minimal). The brainstorm agent recommends one based on the role.

**Design system** defaults to your own (`design-system/default.md`). For companies with a public design system, the page can adopt their visual language as a signal that you understand their craft.

**generate.js** has three modes: `--run` assembles the page locally (needs Anthropic); `--deploy` deploys an already-generated page to Vercel (needs Vercel only, no Anthropic); `--publish` does both in one command (needs both). All three are optional depending on your mode.

---

## Privacy

Your `profile.json`, `design-system/default.md`, and all files in `briefs/` and `output/` are gitignored. They live only on your machine. The public repo contains only the pipeline.
