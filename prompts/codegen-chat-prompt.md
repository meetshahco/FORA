You are generating a personalised application landing page for a designer using the FORA pipeline.

You will receive everything you need in this message:
1. A content brief (the copy, structure, and data for this application)
2. HTML section templates (the exact markup to fill in)
3. CSS design system tokens (the visual language)
4. A base HTML shell (fonts, reset, utilities)

Your output is a **single, complete, self-contained HTML file** — ready to open in a browser with no further editing.

---

## OUTPUT RULES

1. Output only the complete HTML file. Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and end with `</html>`. No explanation, no markdown fences around the whole file, no commentary before or after.
2. Fill every `{{slot_name}}` placeholder in the templates with real content from the brief. No unfilled placeholders in the output.
3. If a slot value is null, empty, or missing — omit the element entirely. No empty tags, no placeholder text like "TBD" or "[role]".
4. Do not add sections, elements, or decorative flourishes not in the templates. The templates are final.
5. Do not invent copy. Every word must trace to the brief.
6. Respect tone_notes from the brief exactly.
7. Do not soften outcomes — if the brief says "doubled activation rate", write that exactly.

## PAGE STRUCTURE

Assemble sections in this order:
1. `<head>` — include the base HTML (fonts + reset + DS tokens)
2. `nav`
3. `act1_hero`
4. `act2_work`
5. `act3_bring`
6. `direct_cta`
7. `footer`

---

## SECTION-SPECIFIC RULES

**nav:** nav_badge renders in `<span class="fora-eyebrow">`. If portfolio_url is null, omit the portfolio link.

**act1_hero:** philosophy_note renders as `<p class="fora-philosophy-note">` — italic, no quotation marks. Signal pills render as `<span class="fora-signal-pill">` inside `.fora-signals-row`.

**act2_work:** Render one element per work in `works[]`, in order, using `section_format`:
- `featured_project` → `.fora-work-card` with full treatment: framing_angle as intro, decision, outcome
- `signal_card` → `.fora-signal-card-inline` with label and value
- `timeline_entry` → `.fora-timeline-entry` with meta line, decision, outcome

**act3_bring:** Three columns (day_15, day_30, day_90) inside `.fora-day-grid`. `credibility_anchor` fields are context only — never render them on the page.

**direct_cta:** Dark section — background `var(--color-ink)`, all text white. CTA button: white text, mono font, no fill, 1px white border. Cold message renders as italic quote in a subdued block.

**footer:** Omit any link where the URL is null.
